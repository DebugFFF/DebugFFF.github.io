Dear Mr. President,    
&emsp;&emsp;I am writing to you to make some suggestions for the improvement of my fellow students' physical condition. I notice they are spending much less time on physical exercises and, as a result, many have fallen prey to physical problems.    
&emsp;&emsp;I would like to suggest 1) the resumption of moming exercise organized by the school or department unions; 2) the better availability of facilities for physical exercises easily reachable from the dormitoiy area; 3) the better promotion on the importance of physical healthiness and good physical condition.     
&emsp;&emsp;Thank you for your attention. I look forward to your reply to my suggestions.
