The column chart clearly reveals the statistics of students taking part-time jobs in a certain university. According to the survey, there has been a steady increase from 67.77%to 71.93% of students from freshmen to juniors holding temporary jobs, while the percentage of seniors working part-time has jumped markedly to 88.24%.

While part-time work does have the potential to negatively affect college students' studies, it can also be good for their future careers. It's obvious that doing a part-time job can adversely affect students' studies because it drains their energy. Part-time employmentcan also be detrimental to students by damaging their incentive to study. Despite the abovedisadvantages, working part-time on campus also offers several potential benefits. For one, it can help students better understand their preferences or to test out a possible career direction. Additionally, companies seeking to recruit fresh graduates will give preference to those with part-time experience.

In the end, the impact of part-time work on students' academic performance depends on their ability to maintain a balance between their studies and the part-time job. If students are able to manage their time effectively and secure a part time position in a field related to their studies or interests, the job is certain to yield a positive impact.
