Dear Jack,   
&emsp;&emsp;Thanks for your congratulations! Since you asked for advice on translation,I'd like to offer several constructive proposals as follows.     
&emsp;&emsp;First of all, while quite a number of students think they're forced to learn translation merely for English tests, you should learn it for some other purposes like its usefulness other than the examination itself. What is more, in order to become an outstanding translator, it is vital to not only appreciate the beauty and perfection of the language and literature of both English and Chinese, but also to arouse in yourself an interest in exploring something deeper in this filed.    
&emsp;&emsp;I'm sure you'll be an excellent tanslator. Looking forward to your reply!
