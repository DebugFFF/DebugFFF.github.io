Dear Friends,    
&emsp;&emsp;AS the host of the upcoming reading session, I am writing this email to recommend to you my favorite book *Tao Te Citing*, which was written by Lao Tzu.     
&emsp;&emsp;The primary causes of my recommendation are as follows. To begin with, it is the best-loved of all the classical books of China and the most universally popular. In addition,the book encapsulates the main tenets of Taoism, and upholds a way of being as well as a philosophy and  a religion. The dominant image in the book is of the Way, the mysterious path through the whole cosmos modeled on the Milky Way that traverses the heavens.     
&emsp;&emsp;I hope the above information will help you to understand the book. If you need any further information about this selection, please do not hesitate to contact me.

The pie chart above clearly ilustrates the percentage of the residents' spending in a certain city of China during the Spring Festival Vacation. From the statistics given, we may draw the conclusion that the spending on New Year presents is highest among all the four categories, at approximately 40%, whereas the amount spent on transport, gathering and dining, and miscellaneous accounts for about 20% each.

The fundamental factors that contribute to the aforementioned comparison may be summarized as follows. To start with, a New Year gift might be memorable because of the special occasion when it is given. If the present is something that only your best friend knew you had wanted, you will never forget it, since it shows the closeness of your relationship with that friend. In addition, festival presents might be unforgettable since they are related to significant events in your life. For instance, I still remember the first New Year gift my best friend, Leo, gave me.

In summary, people spend a lot on Spring Festival presents for a large number of reasons. Some gifts might be memorable owing to the special person who gave the gift. Others are unforgettable due to the significance of the event. Most of all, it is easy to remember special presents as they give you a signifcant sense of personal worth.
