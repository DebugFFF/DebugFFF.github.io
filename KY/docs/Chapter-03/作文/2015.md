Dear Friends,    
&emsp;&emsp;AS the host of the upcoming reading session, I am writing this email to recommend to you my favorite book *Tao Te Citing*, which was written by Lao Tzu.     
&emsp;&emsp;The primary causes of my recommendation are as follows. To begin with, it is the best-loved of all the classical books of China and the most universally popular. In addition,the book encapsulates the main tenets of Taoism, and upholds a way of being as well as a philosophy and  a religion. The dominant image in the book is of the Way, the mysterious path through the whole cosmos modeled on the Milky Way that traverses the heavens.     
&emsp;&emsp;I hope the above information will help you to understand the book. If you need any further information about this selection, please do not hesitate to contact me.
