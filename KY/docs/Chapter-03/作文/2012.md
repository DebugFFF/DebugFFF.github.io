Dear Sir or Madam:   
&emsp;&emsp;I bought an electronic dictionarg form your online store on January 1 st,but after using it for a short period of time. I found it has some problems.    
&emsp;&emsp;To begin with,the batter needs recharing after a mere 2 hours. This means that I need to carry my charge with me when I go out for a day.In addition,the buttons on electronic dictionary are so small that it is nearly impossable to type anything with them. Personally,I find this to be completely unacceptable.    
&emsp;&emsp;Therefore,I would like either to change for another model that works better or a full refund. Your help is greatly appreciated.
