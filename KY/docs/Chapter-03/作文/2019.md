## 小作文
Dear Professor Smith,      
&emsp;&emsp;It is my great honor to plan a debate on the theme of city traffic. My suggestion is that the specific topic of the debate is: Private Cars-A Blessing or a Curse?    
&emsp;&emsp;The primary reasons are as follows. On the one hand, some claim that there are many advantages in possessing a car. It gives a much greater degree of comfort and mobility. On the other hand, others strongly object to developing private cars. They maintain that private cars contribute to traffic congestion so greatly that the advantages gained in comfort and freedom are often cancelled out by the frustration caused by traffic jams.    
&emsp;&emsp;My arrangement is that the debate will be held in the Students' Recreational Center on December 22,2018.I am looking forward to your reply.
