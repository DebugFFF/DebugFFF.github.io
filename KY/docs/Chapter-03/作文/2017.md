Dear Prof. Williams,    
&emsp;&emsp;I am extremely honored to accept your invitation to give a presentation to a host of foreign students on Chinese culture.    
&emsp;&emsp;Here are the key points of my presentation. First of all, compared with Westerners, the Chinese people have traditionally paid more attention to the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature. "Nature and Man are one" is a familiar statement in traditional Chinese ideology. In addition, in Chinese thought, much emphasis is laid upon moral cultivation, the refinement of temper, and the spiritual enlightenment on the part of individual rather than upon logical reasoning.    
&emsp;&emsp;My appreciation to you for your generous help is beyond words.I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

The line graph clearly illustrates that the number of museums in China and their number of visitors both increased markedly between 2013 and 2015. Based upon the data given above, we can see that the number of museums has risen dramatically from 4,165 to 4,692 during the three years, while the amount of visitors jumped from 637 million to 781
million in the same time.

Museums hold an attraction and fascination for most people, of all ages, from young children to the elderly, for at least two fundamental reasons. The first reason many people are interested in visiting a museum is to learn about the history and culture of a place. A country's capital city, like Beijing, London or Paris, is a veritable museum lover's paradise, where onecould literally spend days visiting dozens of museums. Another reason why people visit museums is that they are not only for adults, but for the whole family--a wonderful activity enjoyed by children as well as grandparents. It gives the whole family something they can spend several hours together doing, and for free or at a reasonable cost.

In summary, people enjoy visiting museums because doing so helps them to understand the history and culture of the place, be it at a local, regional, national or international level. Meanwhile, it is an educational and cultural experience that can be enjoyed by the whole family.
