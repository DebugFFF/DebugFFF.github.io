Dear Professor Smith,     
&emsp;&emsp;I am looking forward to my traveling to the United States and visiting you in Harvard University.    
&emsp;&emsp;Unfortunately,I have recently been diagnosed with a serious ear infection which will require surgery on the same day as my departure.I am sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the travel plan. If possible,I would like to postpone the travel plan toanother day later in this year. I promise that such a situation does not usually happen, and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.    
&emsp;&emsp;Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of my situation sooner. Your prompt attention to my suggestion would be highly appreciated.
