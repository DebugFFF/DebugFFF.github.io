To begin with, it is the best-loved of all the classical books of China and the most universally popular. In addition,the book encapsulates the main tenets of Taoism, and upholds a way of being as well as a philosophy and a religion. The dominant image in the book is of the Way, the mysterious path through the whole cosmos modeled on the Milky Way that traverses the heavens.  I hope the above information will help you to understand the book.

Since you asked for advice on translation,I'd like to offer several constructive proposals as follows.  First of all, while quite a number of students think they're forced to learn translation merely for English tests, you should learn it for some other purposes like its usefulness other than the examination itself. What is more, in order to become an outstanding translator, it is vital to not only appreciate the beauty and perfection of the language and literature of both English and Chinese, but also to arouse in yourself an interest in exploring something deeper in this filed.  I'm sure you'll be an excellent tanslator. Looking forward to your reply! 大作文 "},"docs/Chapter-03/作文/2017.html":{"url":"docs/Chapter-03/作文/2017.html","title":"2017年","keywords":"","body":"2017 小作文 Dear Prof. Williams,  I am extremely honored to accept your invitation to give a presentation to a host of foreign students on Chinese culture.  Here are the key points of my presentation. First of all, compared with Westerners, the Chinese people have traditionally paid more attention to the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature. \"Nature and Man are one\" is a familiar statement in traditional Chinese ideology. In addition, in Chinese thought, much emphasis is laid upon moral cultivation, the refinement of temper, and the spiritual enlightenment on the part of individual rather than upon logical reasoning.  My appreciation to you for your generous help is beyond words.I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. 大作文 "},"docs/Chapter-03/作文/2018.html":{"url":"docs/Chapter-03/作文/2018.html","title":"2018年","keywords":"","body":"2018 小作文 Dear Professor Smith,  I am looking forward to my traveling to the United States and visiting you in Harvard University.  Unfortunately,I have recently been diagnosed with a serious ear infection which will require surgery on the same day as my departure.I am sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the travel plan. If possible,I would like to postpone the travel plan toanother day later in this year. I promise that such a situation does not usually happen, and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of my situation sooner.

My suggestion is that the specific topic of the debate is: Private Cars-A Blessing or a Curse?  The primary reasons are as follows. On the one hand, some claim that there are many advantages in possessing a car. It gives a much greater degree of comfort and mobility. On the other hand, others strongly object to developing private cars. They maintain that private cars contribute to traffic congestion so greatly that the advantages gained in comfort and freedom are often cancelled out by the frustration caused by traffic jams.  My arrangement is that the debate will be held in the Students' Recreational Center on December 22,2018.I am looking forward to your reply.
